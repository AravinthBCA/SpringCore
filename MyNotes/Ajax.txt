Ajax :

     * Ajax stand for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
	 
	 * We have two ways, a web client communicates to the application running on a server is Synchronous and 
Asynchronous.

     * Synchronous the client sense in a request and wait for the response to come back, he will not be able to
take another action on the browser.

     * Asynchronous he need not wait for the response to come back, he can send in multiple requests and the 
responses will come back at some point later as a result he can perform something on the way instead of just...

Sample Project :

     * Previous we have develope sample project that contains two module, Register User and Dispaly Users module
developed in SpringMVCORM project.

     * To make more realtime project, our idea is you have to enter the id,name and email in Register module
if you enter the id it goto the database check the id is already available or not without submiting the page
using ajax call...

     * Steps : 	Implement the backend Validation DAO layer which will check if the record exists in the db 
without the given id then -> Service Layer -> Controller will be used or called into from the UI through an Ajax 
call, We'll use the Jquery in out jsp page...

SpringBoot :   https://www.javatpoint.com/spring-vs-spring-boot-vs-spring-mvc

     * Java Spring Framework (Spring Framework) is a popular, open source, enterprise-level framework for 
creating standalone, production-grade applications that run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

     * Java Spring Boot (Spring Boot) is a tool that makes developing web application and microservices with 
Spring Framework faster and easier through three core capabilities:
       i) AutoConfiguration
	  ii) An opinionated approach to configuration
	 iii) The ability to create standalone applications.
	 
	 * @SpringBootApplicaiton annotations it merges them into one single annotaiton like @Configuration,
@EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sping-Boot-Starter :

     * We can use the spring-boot-started dependency, we can add this project as a Maven dependency and 
automatically it will bring all the jar files that are required to build a standalone.

     * If we want to develop web MVC application we will add a dependency in our pom.xml called 
spring-boot-started-web.

	 * If we want to use JPA for Java Persistance using Hibernate or whatever ORM. you would include
spring-boot-started-data-jpa it will automatically add jars.

	 * If we want to use Spring Data REST, you will add spring-boot-started-data-rest.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spring JPA :

    * Spring JPA stand for Java Persistance API.
	
	* It is a standard from oracle to do object relational mapping, that is to store our objects into the db and
convert the db rows into objects and deal with them in our object oriented applications.

    * The providers or the implementations of this standard are Hibernate, EclipseLink, OpenJPA and more.
	
	* The JPA standard provides EntityManagerFactory and entityManager,two key interfaces which we use throughout
our application or at lease in the Data Access Layer to perform using CRUD operations.

    * In your DAO layer u write CRUD operation methods right, without writing all that boilerplate coding reduce
SpringData using CRUDReposity interface.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SpringBoot MVC :

    * SpringBoot MVC why we need this because already we have SpringMVC because SpringBoot MVC reduce lots of
boilerplate code like you don't need any external tomcat server because it already embedded in springboot and 
web.xml and dispatcher.xml also predefined so you need chances only in that you can modify in applic.properties
file directly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REST :

    * REST ( Representational State Transfer ) is a bunch of principles or architectural guidelines and HTTP 
allows us to easily implement REST.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REST Priniciple :
    
	* Uniform Interface and Easy access.
	
	* POST to create a rsource, GET to retrieve a resource or read a resource, PUT to update, DELETE delete a 
resource these are also knows as HTTP Verbs.

    * Easy access, HTTP provides an easy access, easy and unique way to identify resources through it's URI and 
URLS ( Ex : URI:/emplyees ) the URI and URLS are knows an NOUNS because they uniquely identify a resource.

    * PUT method is used to update the record in db, your table have name,debp column, you want to update
dept column means you want to send the whole details of the row(it not allow partial resource) otherwise 
remaining things are set to null that why use PATCH it allow partial resource.

    * A MIME type is a label used to identify a type of data. It is used so software can know how to handle the 
data. It serves the same purpose on the Internet that file extensions do on Microsoft Windows, MIME types like
text/xml, application/json, text/plain, hal/json and others.

Java Configuration : 

      * Starting 3.0 version of spring we can configure and use spring without using any xml in our application
that these complete java based configuraiton will be replacing xml with a java class that wil be market with 
@Configuration annotation form spring ones market this annotation tells spring that this particular class is a
class is a source of spring beans.

      * @Bean annotation that being annotation is similar to the bean tag of xml. Ex : @bean
	                                                                                   Car car()
																					   
	  * Suppose you already have Dao config and now create another Service config you need Dao config means no 
need to write another time you can just import the Dao config in the Service Config class.(@Import(Dao.class))

      * You are going to use Java configuration means you need to delete web.xml and dispatcher.xml is 
compulsory.
